# Summary

To continue the work started in October 2020 ([EIP-1559 Community Outreach Report](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/eip-1559-community-outreach-report-aa18be0666b5)), we have gathered additional sentiment on EIP-1559 from leading Ethereum applications. Because the success of the Ethereum ecosystem is tightly linked to its builders, it's important to catalog their perspectives for the community to consider as part of their decision to support EIP-1559 or not.

Outreach started on Jan 25 with the [DeFiPulse top 10 projects](https://defipulse.com/) ranked by Total Value Locked (TVL). Sentiment gathering and education is ongoing. We have also added projects that signaled via [SupportEIP1559.org](https://supporteip1559.org/) to this repo.

Collectively, these applications represents over **$21B in value locked**. (as of Feb. 23, 2021)

If you would like to add or update a position, please add an issue to the repo with:

- org or project name
- link to a public source explicitly claiming one of the following: Support, Neutral, Reject, TBD

While there is no exact precedent for this type of direct survey, given the scope of the change, we thought it important that application communities become familiar with the mechanisms that make 1559 work. It is not expected that explicit polling for EIPs will become common in the future.

**Caveats**

1. Excluding MakerDAO and Lido, these responses only represent the opinion of Core teams, not necessarily the collective perspective of each application's community.
2. Note that just because an org / project is not represented here, that doesn't mean they are against the proposal.
